## Welcome to ZK Send

ZK Send is a Telegram bot that lets you send SOL privately using zero-knowledge proofs. Your funds are secured by Privy's trusted execution environment, and transfers are made private through Privacy Cash.

## Quick start

<Steps>
<Step title="Start the bot">
Open Telegram and send `/start` to the ZK Send bot. This initializes your account and creates or restores your Privy wallet.
</Step>
<Step title="Set up your wallet">
- `/start` lets first-time users choose between keeping the freshly generated embedded wallet or importing an existing key inline
- You can revisit `/import` later to add more wallets
</Step>
<Step title="Check your balance">
Run `/balance` to see your current SOL balance.
</Step>
<Step title="Send SOL privately">
Use `/send` to transfer SOL. The bot handles the entire privacy flow automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Key concepts

### Private transfers

When you send SOL via `/send`, the bot:

1. Deposits your SOL into Privacy Cash
2. Generates a zero-knowledge proof
3. Withdraws to your recipient

This makes the transfer private—the recipient and amount are hidden on-chain.

### Wallet custody

- **Privy manages your keys**: Private keys are stored in Privy's TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
- **Bot has signer permissions only**: The bot can request signatures but never sees your raw keys
- **You can export**: Embedded wallets can be exported if needed

### Multi-wallet support

You can link multiple wallets to your account:

- View all wallets with `/wallets`
- Switch the active wallet anytime
- Each wallet is managed independently

## Security best practices

- **Never share private keys**: The bot auto-deletes imported keys, but be careful
- **Verify recipient addresses**: Double-check addresses before sending
- **Use secure devices**: Access the bot from trusted devices only
- **Monitor your balance**: Check `/balance` regularly to catch unauthorized activity
