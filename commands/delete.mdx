title: "/delete"
description: "Remove your ZK Send account (Privy data preserved for recovery)"
---

## Overview

The `/delete` command soft-deletes your ZK Send account. Your Privy wallet data remains intact, so you can return later without losing funds.

## What gets deleted

- **Supabase profile**: Your user record is marked as `status = 'deleted'`
- **Active sessions**: All active bot sessions are revoked
- **In-flight jobs**: Any pending transfers or background jobs are cancelled

## What's preserved

- **Privy wallets**: All wallet data remains in Privy's custody
- **Transaction history**: Historical transfers are retained for compliance (2-year retention)
- **Recovery path**: You can restore your account by running `/start` again

<Info>
  This is a soft delete. Your data is marked as deleted but not permanently removed, allowing for account recovery.
</Info>

## Account recovery

If you delete your account and want to return:

1. Run `/start` in Telegram
2. The bot will restore your Privy session
3. Your wallets and transaction history will be available again

<Note>
  Recovery works because Privy data is preserved. If you also delete your Privy account separately, recovery won't be possible.
</Note>

## Confirmation

The bot will ask you to confirm before deleting. This is a safety measure to prevent accidental deletions.

## When to use

Consider deleting your account if:

- You no longer want to use ZK Send
- You're concerned about account security
- You want to start fresh (though you can also just switch wallets)

<Warning>
  Deleting your account will cancel any in-flight transfers. Wait for active transfers to complete before deleting.
</Warning>
