title: "/start"
description: "Bootstrap your ZK Send account and restore your Privy wallet"
---

## Overview

The `/start` command initializes your ZK Send session. It validates your Telegram account, restores or creates your Privy wallet, and guides you through the onboarding flow.

## What it does

1. **Validates your Telegram user** against the Supabase database
2. **Restores your Privy session** if you're a returning user, or creates a new embedded wallet for new users
3. **Walks you through wallet setup** so brand-new users can either keep the freshly generated embedded wallet or import an existing key inline

<Note>
  `/start` is idempotent. Re-running it is the safest way to recover from partial onboarding states or session issues.
</Note>

## For new users

When you first run `/start`, the bot will:

- Create your account in Supabase
- Generate a new Privy embedded wallet
- Offer a choice: keep the embedded Privy wallet that was just generated, or paste an existing private key via the inline import flow (the bot deletes the message after parsing).

## For returning users

If you've used ZK Send before, `/start` will:

- Restore your existing Privy session
- Reactivate your last active wallet
- Show a welcome message with quick links to `/balance`, `/wallets`, and `/send`

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot says 'Account not found'">
    This usually means your Telegram user ID isn't in Supabase. Try running `/start` again, or contact support if the issue persists.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Privy session expired">
    The bot will automatically create a new session. Your wallets and transaction history remain intact.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stuck in onboarding">
    Run `/start` again to reset the onboarding state. If you're still stuck, use `/help` to contact support.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next steps

After running `/start`, you can:

- Check your balance with `/balance`
- Use `/import` later to add more wallets beyond what you configured during `/start`
- View your wallets with `/wallets`
- Send SOL privately with `/send`
