description: "Send SOL privately using Privacy Cash zero-knowledge transfers"
---

## Overview

The `/send` command executes a complete private transfer: it deposits SOL from your wallet into Privacy Cash, generates a zero-knowledge proof, and withdraws to your recipient—all in one flow.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose amount">
You can select from preset buttons (`0.1`, `0.25`, `1` SOL), enter a custom amount, or use the `MAX` button to send your entire withdrawable balance (minus fees).
</Step>
<Step title="Enter recipient">
Provide the recipient's Solana wallet address. The bot validates the format and checks against the blocklist if configured.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm transfer">
Review the details and confirm. The bot will:
1. Deposit from your active Privy wallet to Privacy Cash
2. Generate the zero-knowledge proof and note hash
3. Submit the withdrawal to the recipient
4. Log the transaction in Supabase
</Step>
</Steps>

## Amount options

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Preset buttons | Quick-select common amounts (0.1, 0.25, 1 SOL) |
| Custom amount | Type any amount up to your available balance |
| MAX | Automatically calculates max sendable (balance - fees) |

<Warning>
  Privacy Cash charges fees for deposits and withdrawals. The `MAX` option accounts for these fees automatically.
</Warning>

## Recipient validation

The bot validates recipient addresses by:

- Checking the Solana address format (base58, 32-44 characters)
- Optionally checking against the `blocked_addresses` table in Supabase
- Rejecting invalid or blocked addresses with a clear error message

## Transfer lifecycle

1. **Deposit**: SOL moves from your Privy wallet to Privacy Cash
2. **Proof generation**: Privacy Cash SDK creates the zero-knowledge proof
3. **Withdrawal**: Funds are withdrawn to the recipient address
4. **Logging**: Transaction details saved to `private_transfers` table

If any stage fails, the bot will:

- Surface a clear error message
- Persist the error to `transfer_errors` for debugging
- Provide a "Retry" button to replay from the failed stage

## Fees

Privacy Cash charges fees for:

- Depositing into the privacy pool
- Generating zero-knowledge proofs
- Withdrawing to recipients

These fees are automatically deducted from your balance. The exact fee structure depends on Privacy Cash's current pricing.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Insufficient balance">
    Check your balance with `/balance`. Remember that fees are deducted, so you need slightly more than the send amount.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transfer stuck">
    Use the "Retry" button if provided, or contact support with the transaction ID.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid recipient address">
    Double-check the address format. Solana addresses are base58-encoded and typically 32-44 characters long.
