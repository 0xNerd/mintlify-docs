## Overview

The `/wallets` command displays all wallets linked to your account and lets you manage them through inline keyboards.

## What you can do

- **View all wallets**: See every Privy wallet attached to your Telegram account
- **Activate a wallet**: Switch which wallet is used for `/send` and `/balance`
- **Export a wallet**: Get the private key for embedded wallets (sent as self-destructing message)
- **Delete a wallet**: Remove a wallet from your account (Privy data preserved)

## Wallet display

For each wallet, you'll see:

- Wallet address (truncated for readability)
- Current SOL balance (cached, with refresh option)
- Activation status (which wallet is currently active)
- Last activity timestamp

## Activating a wallet

Only one wallet can be active at a time. The active wallet is used for:

- `/balance` queries
- `/send` transfers
- Default wallet operations

<Note>
  The inline keyboard disables the "Activate" button for the wallet that's already active.
</Note>

## Exporting wallets

For embedded Privy wallets, you can export the private key:

- The key is sent as a self-destructing message (auto-deletes after a configured interval)
- Exports are logged with partial fingerprints for audit purposes
- Use this if you need to import the wallet into another application

<Warning>
  Exported private keys are sensitive. Store them securely and never share them. The bot auto-deletes the message, but Telegram may retain it briefly.
</Warning>

## Wallet limits

There is no enforced wallet limit, but pruning unused wallets keeps the UI responsive.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't see my wallet">
    - Make sure you've run `/start` to initialize your account
    - Check if the wallet was deleted (deleted wallets are hidden)
    - Try refreshing the list
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Activation not working">
    Ensure you're clicking the "Activate" button for the correct wallet. The bot will confirm the switch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Export failed">
    Only embedded Privy wallets can be exported. Imported wallets are wrapped by Privy and cannot be exported through the bot.
