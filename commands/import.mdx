description: "Import an existing Solana wallet by providing its private key"

## Overview

The `/import` command lets you import an existing Solana wallet into ZK Send by providing its private key. The key is immediately handed to Privy for secure re-encryption.

## How it works

1. **Send your private key**: Paste your base58-encoded private key in the chat
2. **Auto-deletion**: The bot deletes the message immediately after parsing
3. **Privy wrapping**: The key is passed to Privy for re-encryption in their TEE
4. **Wallet activation**: The imported wallet becomes your active wallet

<Warning>
  Telegram may still store deleted messages for a short period. Use a secure clipboard, paste the key, and consider deleting your chat history afterward.
</Warning>

## Private key format

The bot only accepts **base58-encoded** private keys. Common formats include:

- Raw base58 string (32 bytes encoded)
- Solana CLI keypair format (JSON with `secretKey` array)

<Info>
  If you have a keypair JSON file, extract the `secretKey` array and convert it to base58, or use the Solana CLI to export it in the correct format.
</Info>

## Security considerations

- **Message auto-deletion**: The bot deletes your message immediately after parsing
- **Privy custody**: Imported keys are wrapped by Privy, so custody remains in their TEE
- **No logging**: The bot never logs raw private keys
- **Blocklist check**: The wallet address is checked against `blocked_addresses` before import

## Import limits

You can import as many wallets as you need. Clean up unused wallets from `/wallets` to keep the list manageable.

## After importing

Once imported, the wallet will:

- Appear in your `/wallets` list
- Become your active wallet automatically
- Be available for `/send` and `/balance` commands

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid key format">
    Ensure your private key is base58-encoded. If you have a JSON keypair, extract the `secretKey` array and convert it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Import failed">
    - Check that the key format is correct
    - Verify you haven't hit the wallet limit
    - Ensure the wallet address isn't on the blocklist
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Message not deleted">
    If the message wasn't auto-deleted, contact support immediately. The bot should delete it within seconds of parsing.
