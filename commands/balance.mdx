title: "/balance"
description: "Check the on-chain SOL balance for your active wallet"
---

## Overview

The `/balance` command shows the current SOL balance of your active wallet by querying the Solana blockchain directly.

## How it works

- Queries the Solana RPC endpoint configured via `SOLANA_RPC_URL`
- Displays the balance in SOL with up to 9 decimal places
- Includes a "Refresh" button to fetch the latest balance (bypasses cache)

<Info>
  Balances are cached for 30 seconds by default (configurable via `BALANCE_CACHE_TTL`) to avoid overwhelming the RPC endpoint.
</Info>

## Usage

Simply send `/balance` in your Telegram chat with the bot. The bot will respond with:

- Your active wallet address
- Current SOL balance
- Last updated timestamp
- A "Refresh" button to get the latest balance

## What affects your balance

- **Incoming transfers**: SOL sent to your wallet address
- **Outgoing transfers**: SOL sent via `/send` (includes Privacy Cash fees)
- **Network fees**: Small fees for on-chain transactions

<Note>
  The balance shown is your on-chain balance. If you have funds in Privacy Cash notes (mid-transfer), they won't appear here until the withdrawal completes.
</Note>

    - Click "Refresh" to bypass the cache
    - Verify you're looking at the correct wallet with `/wallets`
